Worked on a data processing C++ application part of the data reduction pipeline of the Euclid project.

Euclid is driven by the European Space Agency (ESA) and is one of the leading project in deep space observation.

My job was was to:
- provide a cross platform framework for scientific tasks
- provide build and test infrastructure
- create integration tools for the Euclid ecosystem.
