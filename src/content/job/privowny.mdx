Worked on cross browser WebExtension written in Preact/Typescript and providing online privacy tools.  
Driving a team between 3 and 5 persons, my main tasks were to:

- increase code quality and maintainability
- setup a in house UI library in collaboration with the UX team
- develop low level communication tools to fit WebExtension specific needs
- much more ...
